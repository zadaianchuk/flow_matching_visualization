I want minimal visualization of ODE solver interavively showing how the point moves from normal to goal (bimodal) distribution. 

create a minimal plan for it. 

My stack is: 
- Uv and Python 
- Streamlit for the UI
- matplotlib for the interactive plots
- lets start from simple Euler solver for ODEs. 
- lets use torch: https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq
